   If you want to add TV information to your website or app then you've come to the right place!

   We provide a free, fast and clean REST API that's easy to use, returns JSON and conforms to the HATEOAS and HAL principles.    The root url is http://api.tvmaze.com and the available endpoints are documented below. If you have any questions or          suggestions regarding the API, please post them on our forums http://www.tvmaze.com/forums/4/api.

   In addition to the free public API, there's a user-level API available for all Premium members                                https://www.tvmaze.com/premium. 
   The documentation for the user API can be viewed here https://static.tvmaze.com/apidoc.
